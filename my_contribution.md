This is my contibution to the project favicon-gen-team-66

I participated in finding out about existing favicon generator websites and i looked out for their flaws and also what they did great, and then came up with what we could do better

I designed the user profile page in both low fidelity and high fidelity for both desktop and mobile view

I made some adjustments in allignments and UI to the sign-up, sign-in, forgot password, and confirmation pages for the low fidelity design

I designed the high fidelity design for the sign-up, sign-in, forgot password, and confirmation pages
