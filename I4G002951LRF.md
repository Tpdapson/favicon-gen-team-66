This is my contibution to the project favicon-gen-team-66

I did a resaerch on other existing favicon generator website to see what they did really right and what they need to improve on and implemented it into my group's design

I designed the user profile page in both low fidelity and high fidelity for Destop and Mobile view (I designed the low-fi from scratch alone and did the hi-fi together with another designer)

I made some adjustments in allignments to the low fidelity design of the sign in, sign up, forgot password and confirmation pages for desktop

I designed the high fidelity design of the sign in, sign up, forgot password and confirmation pages for desktop view alone

I came up with the name for our project (GenZicons)
